# Weather Dashboard

In this assignment, I curated a page that allows the user to search for a city, or to geo-locate to the current city of the user. There is the search bar on the left hand side where the local storage will display under. On the main interface (to the right) there is the forecast for the day, and below that is a 5 day forecast.
